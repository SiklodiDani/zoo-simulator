# Zoo-Simulator made using React and REDUX

You can make time pass by one hour by pressing the "SkipTime" button, which reduces the health of each animal by a random 
percentage between 0 and 20.
You can feed the animals by pressing the "FeedAnimals" button, which increases their health by a random percentage between 10
and 25 depending on the type of animal. Each type of animal is pronounced dead after it's health reaches a certain percentage.
The state of all animals gets updated each time a button is clicked.
